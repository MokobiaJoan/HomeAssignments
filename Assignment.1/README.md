Build: Use `make` command

launch: run `./main `executable

This project is built with c++, and the g++ compiler was used to compile my code into what the computer understands <<binary,0 and 1>>. My main file consits of a simple Hello world! and aslo returns a <<Hello, "input">> which loops. To stop this loop you need to enter "exit" when an input is passed.
Please use the command written in the build and launch to run this project.
